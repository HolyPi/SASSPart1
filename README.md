# SASS Intro

SASS is a langauge for creating CSS styles. SASS compiles to CSS.

## Challenges 

Open index.html in your browser and take a look. 

Open the style.scss in your editor. This file is written in the SASS language but it looks like regular CSS. 

Run the SASS compiler. 

sass --watch style.scss style.css

Regular CSS code compiles from SASS. 

The code here, like most CSS is not DRY, it tends to have a lot of repeated values and code. This is not uncommon because of the nature of CSS. 

SASS allows you to use variables, if statements, for loops, lists, and other structures not available in CSS.

### Challenge 1
